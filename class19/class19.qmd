# 1. Investigating pertussis cases by year

## Is Pertussis on the rise?

The CDC track reported pertussis cases in US and make their data available here:

https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html

Q1. With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called cdc and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.

```{r}
cdc <- data.frame(
                          Year = c(1922L,
                                   1923L,1924L,1925L,1926L,1927L,1928L,

# 2. A tale of two vaccines (wP & aP)

Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
baseplot + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1946,
                      linetype = 2,
                      color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996,
                      linetype = 2,
                      color = "red")
```

Answer: Vertical dashed lines were added at x = 1946 and x = 1996. These lines correlate with the introduction of the vaccines wP and aP, respectively. I notice that the wP and aP vaccine drastically decreased the number of reported cases of pertussis per year. The wP vaccine is effective in the short term as well as long term; the aP vaccine seems to have less of an effect on pertussis than the aP vaccine. 

Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

Answer: After the introduction of the aP vaccine, cases began to rise slightly. The observed trend can be a result of anti-vaxxers, waning vaccine effectiveness, and the emergence of variants of the virus. 

# 3. Exploring CMI-PB data

## The CMI-PB API returns JSON data

The CMI-PB resource is studying and making available data on the immune response to Pertussis vaccination. 

It mostly returns JSON format that we need to process and convert into something useable in R. 

We will install the jsonlite package for this.

```{r}
# Allows us to read, write and process JSON data
library(jsonlite)
```

```{r}
subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
```

```{r}
head(subject, 3)
```

Q4. How may aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

Answer: There are 47 aP and 49 wP infancy vaccinated subjects in the dataset. 

Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

Answer: There are 30 male and 66 female subjects/patients in the dataset.

Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex, subject$race) 
```

Answer: Breakdown presented in the chart above.

## Side-Note: Working with dates

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
today()
```

```{r}
today() - ymd("2000-01-01")
```

```{r}
time_length( today() - ymd("2000-01-01"),  "years")
```

Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are they significantly different?

```{r}
# Use todays date to calculate age in days
subject$age <- today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

ap <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "aP")
round( summary( time_length( ap$age, "years" ) ) )
```

```{r}
# wP
wp <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "wP")
round( summary( time_length( wp$age, "years" ) ) )
```

Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?

```{r}
int <- ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
age_at_boost <- time_length(int, "year")
head(age_at_boost)
```

Answer: Ages are calculated above.

Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot (see below), do you think these two groups are significantly different?

```{r}
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(time_length(age, "year"),
      fill=as.factor(infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac), nrow=2) 
```

```{r}
# Or use wilcox.test() 
x <- t.test(time_length( wp$age, "years" ),
       time_length( ap$age, "years" ))

x$p.value
```

Answer: These two groups are significantly different. The p-value is <<< than 0.05. In addition, the group who recieved the aP vaccine are much younger than the group who recieved the wP vaccine. This is because the aP vaccine was introduced many years after the wP vaccine. 

## Joining multiple tables

```{r}
# Complete the API URLs...
specimen <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
titer <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
head(specimen)
head(titer)
```

Q9. Complete the code to join specimen and subject tables to make a new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their associated subject details:

```{r}
meta <- inner_join(specimen, subject)
dim(meta)
```

Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female etc.

```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(titer, meta)
dim(abdata)
```

Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entries in abdata) do we have for each isotype?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```

Answer: IgE has 6698 specimens. IgG has 1413 specimens. IgG1 has 6141 specimens. IgG2 has 6141 specimens. IgG3 has 6141 specimens. IgG4 has 6141 specimens. 

Q12. What do you notice about the number of visit 8 specimens compared to other visits?

```{r}
table(abdata$visit)
```

Answer: Visit 8 specimens are drastically lower compared to other visits. This is due to the fact that this is an ongoing study and participants are still coming in for their visit 8. 

# 4. Examine IgG1 Ab titer levels

Make a summary plot of antigen levels.

```{r}
ig1 <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG1", visit!=8)
head(ig1)
```

Q13. Complete the following code to make a summary boxplot of Ab titer levels for all antigens:

How do these change over time? - one viz that may be helpful is to facet that adobe plot by visit number.

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac, visit), nrow=2)
```
